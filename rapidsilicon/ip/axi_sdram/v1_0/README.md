# AXI-SDRAM Core Generation 
## Introduction
AXI-SDRAM is AXI4 based IP core.


## Generator Script
This directory contains the generator script which places the RTL to `rapidsilicon/ip/axi_sdram/v1_0/<build-name>/src/` directory and generates its wrapper in the same directory. 



## TCL File

This python script also generates a raptor.tcl file which will be placed in `rapidsilicon/ip/axi_sdram/v1_0/<build-name>/synth/` directory.
