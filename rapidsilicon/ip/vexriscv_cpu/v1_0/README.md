# AXI VexRiscv Core Generation 
## Introduction

VexRiscv is an AXI based IP core.

## Generator Script
This directory contains the generator script which places the RTL to `rapidsilicon/ip/vexriscv_cpu/v1_0/<build-name>/src/` directory and generates its wrapper in the same directory. 

## CPU Type
These are the types of VexRiscv core that can be generated: -

| Sr.No.|      CPU TYPE                      |       Keyword      |    Value        |
|-------|------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
|   1.  | Uncached CPU without MMU           |     base_variant   |    0 / 1        |
|   2.  |   Cached CPU with MMU              |     cached_with_mmu|    0 / 1        |
|   3.  |Cached CPU with MMU, PLIC and CLINT |cached_with_mmu_plic_clint|    0 / 1        |

To generate RTL with above parameters, run the following command:
```
python3 vexriscv_cpu_gen.py --cached_mmu=True --build
```
If no type is specified, Uncached CPU without MMU is generated by default.
## TCL File

This python script also generates a raptor.tcl file which will be placed in `rapidsilicon/ip/vexriscv_cpu/v1_0/<build-name>/synth/` directory.
